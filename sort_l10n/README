Use l10n_sort.sh to sort localization .inc files in consistent way

CONCEPT

Most of current available .inc files are sorted case insensitive. But
there are many exceptions, especially recently added strings are not
sorted.  If you have edited translations in w2p translation manager
in past saved strings were sorted in different way (case sensitive)
and newly added strings where attached to the tail unsorted at all.

I wrote a patch that will keep sorting of w2p
edited files consistent with upstream sorting style. See
http://github.com/gajdusek/web2project/commits/consistent_sorting_of_localization_files
and previous commit.

Script l10n_sort.sh can be used to repair sorting of .inc files directly,
without need to save them in w2p translation management. It was used
to resort .inc files in mentioned patch and so since the patch will
be accepted to upstream, sorting style of localization files edited in
w2p translation management will be kept consistent for eternity. But if
you add strings directly by editing .inc files you should resort them
(using this script or other way).

This way the sorting style will be kept coherent and localization files
easier to maintain (i.e. to show diffs of new additions, especialy usefull
for check english files, that can be sometimes enhance by translator
with changes usefull for others).

Usage: 
	./sort_l10n.sh <file> <file> ...
	This will sort localization .inc files given as parameters. Bash
	wildcards in filenames will be parsed.

	All ends of lines will be converted to consistent style (default
	to unix style). This can be changed by editing EOL_CONVERTOR
	variable in front of this script.

Example:
	find web2project/locales -type f -iname '*.inc' -print0 | xargs -0 ./sort_l10n.sh
