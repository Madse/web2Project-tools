db_convert_to_utf8.sh and db_convert_to_utf8.php scripts.

GENERAL INFORMATION

These scripts will output SQL statements to convert web2Project database
to utf8. Run resulting SQL statements (i.e. via phpmyadmin) and then
change $w2Pconfig['dbcharset'] option in config.php to utf8. Please
make sure that you use web2Project version with $w2Pconfig['dbcharset']
option supported.

If your database connection charset is already utf8 you can safely change
this option to utf8 directly.  Otherwise you must first convert all
strings stored in database to utf8 and then immediately set this option
to utf8.  You will end with damaged strings in tables if database will
be updated by any web2Project user after you convert strings to utf8
but before you set 'dbcharset' option to utf8.

SCRIPTS USAGE

1) db_convert_to_utf8.sh
Run without parameters to get full help displayed. 
Script parameters are same as mysqladmin options, 
i.e: ./db_convert_to_utf8.sh -h <host> -u <user> -p[<password>] <database> >> web2project_convert.sql
Run web2project_convert.sql via phpmyadmin or mysql etc.

2) db_convert_to_utf8.php
Copy this this script to web2Project root directory, point you browser
to this script. It will print sql statements to convert database. Run
these statements via phpmyadmin. Don't forget to delete this script
after you are done.

IMPORTANT WARNINGS:

* Scripts will convert all tables in the database. Table prefix is
not supported (because it is not fully supported by current web2Project
version).

* VERY IMPORTANT: Make sure tables content will not be updated until you
finish database conversion and set new $w2Pconfig['dbcharset'] value!
